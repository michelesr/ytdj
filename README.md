DJ with Youtube Players!

How to: you will se two pairs of textbox and button, in order to start a video you must provide the video ID (for example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An2a1_Do_fc has An2a1_Do_fc as ID) and click "Load" to start the video. 

For now you can only mix using the two separated volume control on the embeeded players or using the fader. 

You can try the player on https://michelesr.github.io/ytdj/ytdj.html

Enjoy!
