DJ with Youtube Players!

How to: you will se two pairs of textbox and button, in order to start a video you must provide the video ID (for example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An2a1_Do_fc has An2a1_Do_fc as ID) and click "Load" to start the video. NEW: you can also provide URL now instead of ID, the software will try to parse it and get the id. 

Use the fader to mix audio! You can set local volume for a video using the control that i provided (please don't use youtube volume control).  
There's 2 fader mode: 50-50 and 100-100, that are related to the crossfading mode, and they indicate the value of the volumes when the mixer is on the middle position.

Try to loop the videos: use z to loop video1 and x to loop video2. How? press the key one time to get start time, two times to get end time and start the loop, three time to release the loop. 

Hide the video pressing "h" key.

You can try the player on https://michelesr.github.io/ytdj/ytdj.html

Enjoy!
